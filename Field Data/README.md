# Guide to Field Data Folder

This file contains raw and processed data used in our analyses. The 2015 and 2021 folders contain raw plot data.

Tables constructed for models are placed in MODEL1 (site-based recession model) and MODELS2-4 (plot-based native dominance and richess models) folders. These tables contain several sites, and columns/variables that were not used in our models, but we chose to keep them should the be of use to other researchers in the estuary.
