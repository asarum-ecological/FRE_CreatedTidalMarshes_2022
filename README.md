# Fraser River Estuary Created Tidal Marsh Study

The following repo contains files used in the 2022 study entitled "Factors influencing the persistence of created tidal marshes in the 
Fraser River Estuary, British Columbia". 

Marsh data were collected in 2015 and 2021. Data from 2015 were collected by Megan Lievesley and Daniel Stewart (BC Conservation Foundation), with funding and direction from Brad Mason and Rob Knight (Community Mapping Network), B.C. Conservation Foundation, and the National Wetland Conservation Fund. Data from 2021 were collected by Daniel Hennigar and Robyn Ingham (Ducks Unlimited Canada) and Daniel Stewart (Asarum Ecological Consulting), and was funded by B.C. Wildlife Federation's Wetlands Workforce project and supported by the Healthy Watersheds Initiative.

The repo contains [raw field data](https://github.com/dstewart86/FRE_CreatedTidalMarshes_2022/tree/main/Field%20Data) including tables assembled for models, [analysis results](https://github.com/dstewart86/FRE_CreatedTidalMarshes_2022/tree/main/Results), [R scripts](https://github.com/dstewart86/FRE_CreatedTidalMarshes_2022/tree/main/R%20Scripts), and [figures](https://github.com/dstewart86/FRE_CreatedTidalMarshes_2022/tree/main/Paper%20Figures) used in the paper.
